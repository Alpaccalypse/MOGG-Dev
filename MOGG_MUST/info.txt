[NAME:Mammals of Gluttony & Greed - Mustelids]
[DESCRIPTION:This introduces mustelids (weasels, badgers, otters and more) and their diary products (mutelid/musty milk & cheese), to Mammals of Gluttony and Greed. It also adds extra preferences and some missing biome tags.]
[STEAM_CHANGELOG:Fix - minor - I missed giant otters when fixing swapped gender names for otters. This corrects that. Only impact in-game was purely cosmetic, though may have caused alarm when you're dwarves would have appeared to be milking males. You will most likely need this update for the prude patch to work correctly for giant otters, however.]
