[NAME:Mammals of Gluttony & Greed - Dairy]
[DESCRIPTION:Adds extra dairy products and categories for Mammals of Gluttony & Greed - Core. This adds in general categories for dairy products and also adds an increase in value for rare or hard to obtain milk and cheese. It makes the list of dairy products in the game more readable, rather than tracking every individual creature. You can now get products like "exotic herbivore milk" and "luxury carnivore cheese" which will add a x2 and x3 value to those items, respectively. This mod only changes dairy products that are already obtainable in vanilla DF, but will become even more relevant if you are using some of my other creature expansions that add new dairy products. MOGG - Core is a requirement for this mod and this mod will be a requirement for any creature mods I release that add new milkable creatures.]
[STEAM_CHANGELOG:Fix - accidentally removed wool from animals that had it, leaving hair in its place. Many thanks to Cross Lament for the bug report.]
