[NAME:Mammals of Gluttony & Greed - Absolute Units]
[DESCRIPTION:This modifies the three largest land mammals and their giant variations in DF to be MOGG compatible. All the usual changes; 4 unique preferences for each creature, accurate names and adjectives. It also adds a x3 metrial value multiplier for hippos. This seems fair to me as by many accounts they are the most dangerous animal in the world and both rhinoceroses and elephants get a x5 bonus in vanilla. Due to the value multipliers I have given each creature unique dairy names rather than the generic ones so they stand out as being more special, otherwise all the normal MOGG - Dairy changes are default.]
[STEAM_CHANGELOG:Fix - typo on hippos meant they were not getting modified.]
