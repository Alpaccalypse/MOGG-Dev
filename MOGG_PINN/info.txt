[NAME:Mammals of Gluttony & Greed - Pinnipeds]
[DESCRIPTION:This modifies all pinnipeds (seals and walruses) and their giant variations in DF to be MOGG compatible. All the usual changes; 4 unique preferences for each creature, accurate names and adjectives. It also adds a x2 metrial value multiplier for elephant seals, walruses and their giant counterparts as they are in the top 10 largest aquatic creatures and quite rare to find. Due to the value multipliers I have given these creature types unique dairy names rather than the generic ones so they stand out as being more special. The rest of the seals' dairy products will now be listed as Pinniped's milk/cheese, and described with the adjective "briny"; e.g. boiling briny milk.]
[STEAM_CHANGELOG:Fix - minor - left in 2 logging tags, no impact on game-play, if you are curious, or want to free up a few kb of hard drive space, you might find a few entries for elephant seals and walruses initialising in the logs folder.]
